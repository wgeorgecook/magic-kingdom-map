# One project to rule them all
This is the final project for the [Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/school-of-programming). I am extremely grateful for the fine folks at Udacity and Google for the [Grow With Google scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google). Without this colaboration, this would not be possible.

## Gritty Details
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). To begin, clone this repository, `cd` into it, and run `npm install`. After installing required packages, build the production bundle by running `npm run build` to get things moving. Gotta get the server running, the easiest way is to run `serve -s build`. In the process the local url is copied to your clipboard. Paste it into a browser or navigate to http://http://localhost:5000/ and have fun!

## API Info
This application utilizes two external APIs. Cheif among them is the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial). To generate name, photos, and ratings, I am utilizing [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api).
