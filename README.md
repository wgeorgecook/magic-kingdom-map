# One project to rule them all
This is the final project for the [Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/school-of-programming). I am extremely grateful for the fine folks at Udacity and Google for the [Grow With Google scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google). Without this colaboration, this would not be possible.

## Gritty Details
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). To begin, clone this repository, `cd` into it, and run `npm install`. After installing required packages, run `npm start` to get things moving. Your default browser will open a page with the app running on it.

## API Info
This application utilizes several external APIs. Cheif among them is the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial). Particularly, I am utilizing [PLACEHOLDER](https://www.fake.com/). In additition, the following APIs are being used:
1. The first API I decide to use is used for it's purpose.
2. You can tell this is an API because of the way that it is.
